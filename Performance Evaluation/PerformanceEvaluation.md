# 1.Performance Evaluation

## We designed topologies based on our previous testbed validation design.

# 2.One Mininet

## Two-way Topology(One Mininet):

### Two-way test is the basic experiment to validate the fidelity of our Mininet-Quagga testbed. We conduct a two-way perf test on a simple topology to check the impact of Quagga router in Mininet.

## Fork-in Topology:

## Fork-out Topology:

# 3.Two Mininet

## Two-way Topology(Two Mininet):

### We put two-way test components in two mininet by spliting the one mininet topology symmetrically. The goal is to prove a substitution of virtual link into physical link will not make performance down. 

# 4.Hybrid

## Two-way Topology(Add Pica8):

### There are 2 aspects that need to be evaluated in Hybrid mode: the physical port and Pica8 switch.
