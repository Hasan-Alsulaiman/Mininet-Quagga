\section{Overview}
This document introduces the combination of Quagga with Mininet(SDN emulator). Quagga is an application which can make a Linux system a software router, due to its feature of application we can integrate Quagga into Mininet and make Mininet able to emulate traditional routers which are non-SDN components. This integration extends the functionality of our SDN testbed to support more traditional network experiments than only SDN experiments.

This documents mainly consists of two parts, the first part is focused on the installation and configuration of Quagga on Linux system and run ping tests to check whether Quagga works well with other network components. In the second part, we designed different experiment topologies and conducted in different scenarios to prove the good performance with Quagga integrated.
